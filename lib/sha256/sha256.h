/**
 * @file
 * @brief Interface to a SHA-256 implementation.
 *
 *  Overview:   SHA-256 is a NIST approved cryptographic hashing algorithm
 *              specified in FIPS 180. A hash algorithm maps data of arbitrary
 *              size to data of fixed length.
 *
 *  Security:   SHA-256 provides 128 bits of security against collision attacks
 *              and 256 bits of security against pre-image attacks. SHA-256 does
 *              NOT behave like a random oracle, but it can be used as one if
 *              the string being hashed is prefix-free encoded before hashing.
 *
 *  Usage:      1) call tc_sha256_init to initialize a struct
 *              tc_sha256_state_struct before hashing a new string.
 *
 *              2) call tc_sha256_update to hash the next string segment;
 *              tc_sha256_update can be called as many times as needed to hash
 *              all of the segments of a string; the order is important.
 *
 *              3) call tc_sha256_final to out put the digest from a hashing
 *              operation.
